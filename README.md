# Exoplanet Exploration

## Purpose
This project was a test to try and create a machine learning model off of real world data. 

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.


### Reporting

* [The Deep Learning model is better than the Logistic Regression model.](https://github.com/jesserichter/Another-Exoplanet-ML-Model/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Model.h5)
* The first model I tried was the logistic regression model, using GridSearchCV I went through tons of values. The testing data score turned out to be 80.96% using the best values I found for the settings for the model. Then I used a deep learning model, achieving an accuracy of 86.53%, bringing me to conclude the deep learning model outperforms the logistic regression model.
